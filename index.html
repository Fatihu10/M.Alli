            Muhammad Ali (born January 17, 1942, Louisville, Kentucky, U.S.—died
            June 3, 2016, Scottsdale, Arizona) American professional boxer and
            social activist. Ali was the first fighter to win the world
            heavyweight championship on three separate occasions; he
            successfully defended this title 19 times. Cassius Marcellus Clay,
            Jr., grew up in the American South in a time of segregated public
            facilities. His father, Cassius Marcellus Clay, Sr., supported a
            wife and two sons by painting billboards and signs. His mother,
            Odessa Grady Clay, worked as a household domestic.When Clay was 12
            years old, he took up boxing under the tutelage of Louisville
            policeman Joe Martin. After advancing through the amateur ranks, he
            won a gold medal in the 175-pound division at the 1960 Olympic Games
            in Rome and began a professional career under the guidance of the
            Louisville Sponsoring Group, a syndicate composed of 11 wealthy
            white men.
